# Intuitively, the more often we see a particular feature with a particular code,
# the more confident we should become that this is a real correlation, rather than random noise.
# We want to choose new data points that are likely to make big changes to the posterior.
# However, calculating the posterior exactly is usually intractable.
# Here, we use a crude approximation, comparing two point estimates of the posterior,
# one with strong regularisation (underfitting), and one with weak regularisation (overfitting).
# If the overfitting model makes a confident prediction, while the underfitting model does not,
# this suggests that this data point uses features that we are marginally sure about.
